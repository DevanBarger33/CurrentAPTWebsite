			<h3>Lifting Properly During Spring Cleaning</h3>
		
			<p>Many of us will be spending more time cleaning in the home, garage, and yard. Whether you’re throwing out heavy trash bags or giving away boxes to charity, be sure you’re lifting properly to avoid strain or injury. Keep these tips in mind:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Squat.</strong> Instead of bending over to pick up box of throw-aways, squat down and lift with your legs. </li>
				<li><strong>Avoid Twisting.</strong> Be careful not to twist while you’re lifting. Instead, lift the box or bag to an upright standing position, and then walk to reposition your body to where you need to place the box or bag.</li>
				<li><strong>Split up heavy loads.</strong> If a box is overloaded, take the time to split up the contents with a second box. Taking a second trip is worth keeping yourself from injury.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Don’t forget to take breaks to admire your hard work, grab a drink of water, and catch your breath.</p>

			<h3 id="beattheheat">Beat the Heat</h3>
			<p>The summer heat can take a major toll on one’s body. With a majority of the body being made up of water,it is important that an individual consumes adequate amounts of it a day. One of water’s main functions is to regulate body temperature and this happens through sweating. The more you sweat the more you need to hydrate. By staying hydrated you can maintain your performance and reduce the risk of heat illnesses. In 2004, the Food and Nutrition Board released new dietary reference intakes for water and they stated that women need 91 ounces and men need 125 ounces. These recommendations can increase however in the summer when you are sweating. Signs of moderate dehydration are a dry mouth, sleepiness, thirst, decreased urine output, dry skin, and headaches. If you exerience these symptoms, you should consider sports drinks that replace the salts and electrolytes that you may lose. Stay safe this summer and beat the heat!</p>

			<h3 id ="winterweatherworks">Winter Weather Work</h3>
			<p>Winter weather will be here soon, so we need to be prepared for snow. Shoveling snow can be a strenuous activity and could cause some serious injuries if done incorrectly. Here are a few tips to help survive the winter snow moving:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Find a good shovel with a curved handle to decrease bending in your back. A small, lightweight blade helps to minimize the weight.</li>
				<li>Warm up first by marching in place or performing gentle stretches.</li>
				<li>Use ergonomic techniques by lifting with your legs, by not twisting the back, and by keeping the weight close to your body. Also keep both feet on the ground to help minimize your chance of slipping and falling. </li>
				<li>Pace yourself by taking a few minutes of rest for every 10-15 minutes of work or when you feel fatigued.</li>
				<li>If you have access to a snow blower or plow, use it. Or hire it done!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Following these guidelines can reduce your risk of injury during the winter season.</p>

			<h3 id="backpacks">Avoid Backpack Overloading</h3>
			<p>How much does that backpack weigh? Studies have shown that the weight of a backpack and the amount of time carrying a backpack can impact neck and shoulder posture. If a backpack is 15% of an individual’s body weight, then it is too heavy for a child to maintain proper posture. Many children and older teens develop poor posture while carrying heavy backpack loads, and the affects can be hard to reverse. Avoiding heavy backpacks can mean avoiding chronic back pain.</p>

			<h3 id="summerheat">Avoid Summer Heat Illness</h3>
			<p>Be aware of the hot and humid conditions this summer so that you don’t experience heat cramps, heat exhaustion or heat stroke. To prevent any of these conditions, drink adequate amounts of fluid. Avoid being outside during the hottest parts of the day. The best time to do physical activity is when the sun is not so high in the sky. You can gauge this by making sure that your shadow is taller than you. If you believe someone is experiencing a heat stroke it is important to call 911 immediately.</p>

			<h3 id="freshstart">Make a fresh start when necessary</h3>
			<p>Do you make New Year’s resolutions? Some people are so discouraged from failed goals from the past that they don’t even attempt to make resolutions in January. Developing a healthy lifestyle is a goal worth making permanent. The most important habit is not quitting, but starting again whenever necessary. If you ate too many sweets at holiday parties, start again planning healthy snacks. The present is always a great time to start a new exercise program. If you find yourself feeling sluggish in June, try making a mid-year resolution! If you need motivation and direction for healthy exercise, you can always call and make an appointment with your physical therapist. When you find yourself suffering the consequences of poor lifestyle choices, resolve to start again.</p>

			<h3 id="activeholidays">Stay active during holiday activities</h3>
			<p>Have you made plans for the holidays? Most people do travel planning and meal planning, but what about fitness planning? Holiday exercise sessions are not on most people’s holiday agendas. After all, holidays are for rest, relaxation, and fun! Right? Well, exercise can be fun, and has been proven to help you feel better and rest better. Why skip it over the holidays? Schedule some holiday exercise sessions for fun and relaxation. What about ice skating or Christmas caroling around your neighborhood? If you can’t handle the outdoor temperatures or activities, don’t forget that walking done indoors at a shopping mall counts as exercise, but stopping to browse in the stores doesn’t! Don’t look for parking places near the store entrance. Park out in the lot and walk. You may get in the store faster than searching for a close parking space anyway. Plan fun-filled holiday activities, especially ones that keep you moving.</p>
